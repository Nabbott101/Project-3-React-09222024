This project is to create a todo and contact list. Within the todo, one should have the ability to cross out tasks completed and sort between incomplete and completed. 
One should select "Todo" or "Contact" from nav bar and fill in.
.JS, .CSS technology within React was used
Ideas:
-Format the page so that on could add a todo within the contact page.
-Make the ability to keep the todo and contacts while swapping between pages
-add a feature on todo to text or print the list
